Introduction
============

This is Seong-Kook Shin's personal GNU Emacs scripts.

I use this scripts on both my Gentoo Linux, and my Macbook pro.

Here's a list of notable difference between other init scripts:

* Works on darwin based system (pre-selected fonts, etc.)
* no errors even if some packages are missing
* Korean support (mail, input-method, etc.)
* untabbify & remove-trailing spaces on various source code
* vc-jump (to jump VCS buffer on cvs/svn/git)
* mail address completion
* consistent key-bindings on interpreting lanauges (ruby/python/etc.)
* hungry-delete based on the syntactic context
* `desktop open` command on dired (works on X11 and darwin)
* scale up/down font size on mouse wheel
* pre-defined org-html-export (with bootstrap)
* better window/frame navigation
