Recent Emacs can load the init file from $HOME/.emacs.d/init.el if
$HOME/.emacs is not found.   Using init.el looks better than .emacs because
I can manage all scripts in the same directory. 

    $ cd $HOME
    $ mv emacs-scripts .emacs.d
    $ # Remove if old .emacs still exists.
    $ rm .emacs

Or, you still can use old way; copying files to your $HOME directory
like this.  (Other than

    $ cd $HOME
    $ mv emacs-scripts .emacs.d
    $ ln -s .emacs.d/init.el .emacs
